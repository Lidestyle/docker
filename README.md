# Homework

You will need to run 2 containers with Nginx.
Both containers must have nginx page config files in volume.
Requirements: 
	first container = GREEN page background,
	second container = BLUE page background

Then you have to create service, which will point to both containers.

Result: 
	when we go to service endpoint, and refresh page periodicaly, 
	we will get different background.
